Before Rumford, I made ten other maps for the game. The previous map being Laborde, a payload map that I took a lot of lessons learned from to design Rumford.<br></p><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="the-gamemode-payload">The Gamemode Payload</h2><p>Team Fortress 2 has many gamemode to pick and choose from. You can fight across mid-sections of maps to push into the other team's base and retrieve the flag in Capture The Flag. Battle over the centerpoint of a map with King of the Hill with an everlasting battle always changing hands depending on the team composition. Fight in an uphill battle for several checkpoints or defend against it with Attack/Defend. Battle back and forth across an entire map with the fast paced back-and-forth gameplay of 5CP (5 control points). Even race the other team in pushing your payload to the end of the track in Payload Race. Then of course there’s the multistage variants of Attack/Defend, Payload Rush, and Payload.<br><br>Then there’s Payload, the gamemode with similar concepts to Attack/Defend but different enough to make players go “hey what’s that!” and suck them into several matches. Payload is the gamemode where BLU team is pushing a cart through several checkpoints to the end of the map, called the finale. RED team is defending all of these checkpoints of course, whether it be two, three, four, or even five in some cases. Did I mention it can be multi stage? That wasn’t the finale you captured, that was the first of three stages.<br><br>The payload cart isn’t just a normal thing you push in-game either, it’s more than that. The payload cart also heals those who dedicate their time in the round to pushing and even goes as far as replenishing their ammo. The more players that push the cart, the faster it goes, until you hit the limit. The payload cart can also roll back if you don’t touch it long enough, so stay on it at all times.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Payload#/media/File:BLU_Bombcart.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/BLU_Bombcart.png" height="739" width="573" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/BLU_Bombcart-xs.png 300w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/BLU_Bombcart-sm.png 480w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/BLU_Bombcart-md.png 768w"></a></figure><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="the-contest">The Contest</h2><p>Being the 50th contest TF2Maps.net hosted there had to be some special twist to it and in fact there was! The contest Rule of Threes was a contest focused around 3 contests running at the same time where each of the restraints/objectives was that you had to have at least and no more than three of the objectives. Seems simple right? Three checkpoints in a payload map, three control points in attack/defend, three control points on a 5CP… that would just be 3CP then, three stages in any multistage map, you get the idea. After having work on Laborde for a long time and pushing 48 updates to the map I wanted to start a new project, in comes Rumford.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/ro3-2.PNG" height="276" width="996" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/ro3-2-xs.PNG 300w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/ro3-2-sm.PNG 480w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/ro3-2-md.PNG 768w"></figure><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="early-design-ideas">Early Design Ideas</h2><p>So a new contest has dropped and I’m itching to make a new idea. After having spent ages on Laborde and it basically becoming my labor of love, I got a kind of reputation as the payload enjoyer, which was right. Payload in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable game modes in Team Fortress 2. I have spent hours in matches before on maps having a blast and getting all wide eyed at maps that are beautiful and tell a story. I also wanted to tell a story with payload since BLU team is progressing through the map, but what is that story?<br><br>From the beginning I’ve always struggled with coming up with a name for a new project. Some mappers choose town names, national park names, other languages translated to English, or simple phrases combined into one. Things like Dixie, Altitude, Snowbase, Badlands, or Laborde, one of my other maps. I settled on something from my home state where I spent a decent amount of time in high school playing sports. Rumford, a small mill town in northern Maine with their famous paper mill. This is where I also settled on the theme, Alpine where I tell the story of how a paper mill works.<br></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Rumford_Paper_Mill_2.JPG" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/Rumford_Paper_Mill_2.JPG" height="2736" width="3648" alt="View of the Rumford Maine paper mill." sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/Rumford_Paper_Mill_2-xs.JPG 300w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/Rumford_Paper_Mill_2-sm.JPG 480w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/Rumford_Paper_Mill_2-md.JPG 768w"></a><figcaption>Via Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="how-does-a-paper-mill-work">How Does a Paper Mill Work?</h2><p>Like most things, paper making isn’t as simple as people think it is. It’s a complex process that requires a massive facility and thousands of moving parts. I spent hours researching the complex process of making paper so I could have an understanding of what my story should be in the map. In comes YouTube, Wikipedia, and many other resources on the internet.<br><br>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uh3XIadm1A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uh3XIadm1A</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gj4J-2SJMI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gj4J-2SJMI</a><br><a href="https://www.dssmith.com/media/our-stories/2020/7/how-is-paper-made-our-paper-production-process">https://www.dssmith.com/media/our-stories/2020/7/how-is-paper-made-our-paper-production-process</a><br><br>I quickly learned there were lots of steps to making paper and I had less than ten points where I could tell the story of paper. I had to sketch this out on paper and see how many areas I had to work with. I had about maybe five to six areas where I could tell how paper was made. Starting with the first courtyard just prior to A, I could show how the logs used to make the paper would be brought in. Checkpoint A where I could show how the logs were turned into wood chips. Courtyard before B where I could show how the wood chips were transported to massive storage facilities along with a dam that powers the mill. Checkpoint B where you see the massive mill from the outside and how it transitions into an industrial landscape from the woods. Courtyard before C where I show how the wood chips are turned into paper pulp. Checkpoint C, the finale, where I can show the paper rolling and shipping process. All of these things shaped and influenced the map design.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/rough-layout-idea.png" height="2500" width="1800" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/rough-layout-idea-xs.png 300w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/rough-layout-idea-sm.png 480w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/rough-layout-idea-md.png 768w"></figure><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="early-design-concepts">Early Design Concepts</h2><p>Now that I had a basic understanding of what the starting and final stages needed to be in terms of theme, it was time to start blocking out some ideas. I knew the first area had involve more wooded areas compared to last while still delivering on the theme I wanted to follow. From the beginning I wanted to have a train in the map and that was an important set piece in the first area. Similar to Barnblitz, a Valve map in Team Fortress 2, I decided to elevate the train above the play area so that the player could still see it but not have to worry about fighting around it.<br></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-columns="1"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/gallery/20210217222515_1.jpg" data-size="1920x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/gallery/20210217222515_1-thumbnail.jpg" height="405" width="720" alt=""></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/gallery/20210226180720_1.jpg" data-size="1920x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/gallery/20210226180720_1-thumbnail.jpg" height="405" width="720" alt=""></a></figure></div></div><p>Because of the contest I was limited to having three checkpoints where most traditional payload maps have four to five. My previous payload map, Laborde, had five checkpoints and was considered a long map. I was not used to three checkpoints. I decided to implement what was called a “delay mechanic” between Checkpoint B and the finale. Barnblitz does a similar thing just before Checkpoint B by using a turntable that stops the payload cart and holds it for about 10-15 seconds. I decided to do the same thing and have it be a mini checkpoint.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/20210226180745_1.jpg" height="1080" width="1920" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/20210226180745_1-xs.jpg 300w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/20210226180745_1-sm.jpg 480w, https://nesman.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/20210226180745_1-md.jpg 768w"></figure><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="testing-the-map">Testing The Map</h2><p>This article is still a Work In Progress.
